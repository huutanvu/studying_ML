We can add variables that we think it will impact the model, it means we can fit the model better. We will calculate $R^2$ to see if it changes. Good thing is $R^2$ will never decrease. So the new added variable will affect the residual error $SS_{res}$, we want the new variable will help to minimize the residual (find a coefficient that helps). If you cannot reduce $SS_{res}$, it just make the model more complex, so just throw it out (set $b_3$ to 0). However, it cannot be exactly 0, because it has a random correllation. So, if we add a new variable, it will surely increase $R^2$, so we cannot know if the added variable helps or not\n",
