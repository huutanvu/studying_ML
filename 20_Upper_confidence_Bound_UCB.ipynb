    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning is a branch of Machine Learning, also called Online Learning. It is used to solve interacting problems where the data observed up to time **t** is considered to decide which action to take at time **t + 1**. It is also used for Artificial Intelligence when training machines to perform tasks such as walking. Desired outcomes provide the AI with reward, undesired with punishment. Machines learn through **trial and error**.\n",
